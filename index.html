          <p>
            <strong>Invader Zim</strong> is an American animated science fiction
            dark comedy <em>television series created</em> by comic book writer
            and cartoonist Jhonen Vasquez for Nickelodeon. The series centers on
            the titular character Zim (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz), an
            extraterrestrial from the planet Irk. His mission is to conquer
            Earth and enslave the human race along with his malfunctioning robot
            servant GIR (Rosearik Rikki Simons). However, Zim is antagonized by
            Dib (Andy Berman), a young paranormal investigator who is determined
            to stop Zim from succeeding. Nickelodeon contacted Jhonen Vasquez
            about pitching ideas for an animated series for their older
            demographic[12][13][14] and Invader Zim was the first thing he
            pitched. In Vasquez's words "it went from pitch to series without
            hardly any waiting".[15] As the series went on, ratings declined and
            budgetary issues became more frequent.[16] Before the second season
            was completed, Nickelodeon cancelled the series, leaving several
            episodes unfinished.[17] The show originally aired on Nickelodeon
            from 2001 to 2002,[16][11] with six of the completed second-season
            episodes initially going unreleased. These episodes were first made
            available on DVD in 2004 and later made their television debut on
            the Nicktoons Network in 2006.[16][18]

            The series centers on Zim (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz),[35] a
            member of the extraterrestrial Irken species and the Irken Empire
            from the planet Irk. The empire's goal is universal conquest and has
            a social hierarchy based solely on physical height. The empire's
            leader is called The Almighty Tallest; at the beginning of the
            series the position is jointly held by two equally tall individuals
            (Wally Wingert and Kevin McDonald). Zim is an outcast; he is
            delusional, very short, overzealous, narcissistic, and
            megalomaniacal.

            Prior to the creation of Invader Zim, Nickelodeon desired a series
            to suit its 11â€“15 year old demographic.[36][37] Nickelodeon producer
            Mary Harrington was searching for something that had a similar
            "edge" to The Ren & Stimpy Show, when she came across a comic book
            called Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and was impressed with the
            art-style and character designs in the series. Harrington contacted
            the creator of JtHM, then-22-year-old Jhonen Vasquez, who had zero
            experience in animation at the time, and asked him if he would like
            to pitch an animated series to Nickelodeon. Vasquez accepted the
            offer.[38][39][40]

          <p>
            When casting voice actors for Invader Zim, Vasquez did not want
            actors who were just capable of doing zany voices because it sounded
            less natural to him. He made a point to cast people with speaking
            voices that were naturally distinct and out of the ordinary so that
            the cast did not have to do unnatural voices, but could instead just
            speak naturally.[43][45] Mark Hamill was originally hired to do the
            voice of Zim for the pilot episode, but was replaced before the
            pilot was shown to Nickelodeon executives because Vasquez felt his
            voice did not feel right for the character.[43] Hamill was replaced
            by voice acting professional Billy West, who remained the voice of
            Zim for the pilot. After the show was picked up for a full series,
            Vasquez decided to replace West with Richard Steven Horvitz (who was
            already voicing the character of Daggett on fellow Nickelodeon
            series, The Angry Beavers), saying that West was "too well known"
            and that he wanted all of the voices for the main characters to be
            unique and not voices people had heard before. Also, due to Futurama
            still being on the air at the time, Vasquez did not want the same
            voice actor to be the lead in two contemporaneous sci-fi
            comedies.[46]
